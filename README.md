## United States Terrorist Attacks from 1970 - 2016

This is a final project for my Data Visualization Course (CS-498) at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UofI) [MCDS](http://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/professional-mcs-program/mcs-data-science-track) program during the Summer 2017 semester. The goal of the project was to utilize [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [Vega](https://vega.github.io/), or [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) to create our narrative visualizations around one of three hybrid structures: a martina glass , interactive slide-show, or drill down story.

My project is over [United States Terrorist Attacks from 1970 - 2016](https://tucker459.github.io/dataviz-finalproj2017/). Where I utilized [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) to code my visualizations and [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/) to create my slideshow. The data was provided by the [National Consortium For The Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism](http://www.start.umd.edu/) through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd). I will continue to work on this project  after the grading has been completed. I want to continue improving upon this project.
