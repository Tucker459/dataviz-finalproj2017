      <h1>United States Terrorist Attacks from 1970 - 2016</h1>
        <p>
          What kinds of attacks have the United States experienced from the last 45 years? Which state is the most prone to be targeted? New York, Montana, Miami! Who knows?
				  As the United States has grown to become the one of the most dominant superpowers in the world and as the leadership has changed numerous times we have experienced terrible times in America from the attacks on our nation.
				  With the help of <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/">National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START)</a> and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd">Kaggle</a> where I recieved the data from.
					I was able to help visualize some of data to these questions.

    <section class="slide">
      <h1>Hybrid Structure</h1>
        <p>
          This presentation utilizes the interactive slideshow hybrid structure which allows the user to follow a story that I have created and dive into details at their leisure.
        </p>
      <h1>Scenes</h1>
        <p>
          This is based off of the <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">deck.js</a> package which allows you create html presentation slideshows. With the numerous available add-ons and features presented by this package I was able to customize my slideshow accordly to capture the user's attention.
        </p>
      <h1>Annotations</h1>
        <p>
          As you mouse over the bars of the bar chart the color of the bar changes to indicate that you are currently over that bar.
        </p>
      <h1>Parameters</h1>
        <p>
          I utilized triggers with my pie chart and bar chart visulaization where you are able to select the state and this displays the count of attacks and percentage of groups.
        </p>
      <h1>Triggers</h1>
        <p>
          I utilized linear ordering by allowing the use of the spacebar, arrow keys, or the arrow buttons presented on the screen to move through the visualization.
        </p>

    <section class="slide">
      <h1>US Terrorism Attacks Types</h1>
      <p>
        This is a bar chart describing the amount of different attack types that happen in the United States. I was able to accomplish this by utilizing Mike Bostock's <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304">Bar Chart</a> example to follow.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="slide">
      <h1>What is being targeted?</h1>
      <p>
        This is a combination of a bar and pie chart describing what kind entity, person, or infrastructure is being targeted and the total amount of attacks by US State over almost half a century. I was able to accomplish this by utilizing Mike Bostock's <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5872848">Dispatching Events</a> as a example to follow.
